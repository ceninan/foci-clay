An idea I had for a "platform". Would consist of various "foci" (DeviceFocus, InputFocus, GraphicFocus, etc.) that would interact with lower-level OS-specific features (or more unrealistically and less useful, be the native API of a new toy OS).

I am not working on this anymore, but maybe I will pick it up again sometime.
